    "description": " We use predictive models to get an idea of how the landscape and storm surge-based flood risk might change with and without restoration and risk-reduction projects over the next half century, which guides our planning. Use of different future scenarios shows how uncertainties about future conditions influence the potential future of our coast and communities. In the summer of 2026, CPRA is soliciting new project ideas from the public for the 2029 Coastal Master Plan. For the first time, some Future Without Action (FWOA) modeling for the 2029 plan is available to share with the public during the new project development phase. CPRA hopes that the material shared here will be useful in the identification of coastal challenges and project ideas to address them."
